      <h1>Hayao Miyazaki</h1>
      <p>
        Hayao Miyazaki is a Japanese Animator, director, producer, screenwriter,
        author, and manga artist. He is widely regarded as one of the most
        accomplished filmmakers in the history of animation. During his time at
        Studio Ghibli, he has been involved in some of the studio's most
        successful films.

      <p>
        Miyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as
        humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the wholesomeness of
        natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and
        craftsmanship, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic in a
        violent world. The protagonists of his films are often strong girls or
        young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous
        antagonists with redeeming qualities.
